# Face_recognition
This is a small project which I did recently which consists of a simple algorithm which takes multiple images of a subject as inputs and give single representative image as an output.
The algo uses SVD to extract important features and face classification is done using "least norm method"(euclidian distance) between the image and representative images.
The algo has given an accuracy of 97% on the Dataset.
The file "main.m" is the main code.
Another file with pre-processing steps is in the folder "Dataset" which can be runned to verify the results.
